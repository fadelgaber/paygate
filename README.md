## Project Status

This project is currently under development and could introduce breaking changes to reach a stable status. We are looking for community feedback so please try out our code or give us feedback!

If you are building from source for v0.8.x please [use the release branch](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate/tree/release-v0.8) which is stable for that series.

## Getting Started

Paygate can be ran or deployed in various ways. We have several guides for running paygate and offer a testing utility called [`apitest` from the moov-io/api repository](https://github.com/moov-io/api#apitest) for verifying paygate (and its dependnecies) are running properly.

- [Using docker-compose](#local-development)
- [Using our Docker image](#docker-image)
- [Build from source](#build-from-source)
- [How to setup open source ACH payments using Moov.io suite](https://medium.com/@tgunnoe/how-to-setup-open-source-ach-payments-using-moov-io-suite-3586757e45d6) by Taylor Gunnoe
  - Taylor has also written [paygate-cli](https://github.com/tgunnoe/paygate-cli) which is a command-line interface to paygate.

</dl>

## Deployment

Paygate currently requires the following services to be deployed and available:

- [ACH](https://github.com/moov-io/ach) (HTTP Server) via `ACH_ENDPOINT`
- [FED](https://github.com/moov-io/fed)  (HTTP Server) via `FED_ENDPOINT`

- The `X-User-Id` (case insensntive) HTTP header is also required and we recommend using an auth proxy to set this. Paygate only expects this value to be unique and consistent to a user.

The following services are required by default, but can be disabled:

- [Accounts](https://github.com/moov-io/accounts) (HTTP server) via `ACCOUNTS_ENDPOINT` and disabled with `ACCOUNTS_CALLS_DISABLED=yes`
- [Customers](https://github.com/moov-io/customers) (HTTP server) via `CUSTOMERS_ENDPOINT` and disabled with `CUSTOMERS_CALLS_DISABLED=yes`

### Docker image

You can download [our docker image `moov/paygate`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/paygate/) from Docker Hub or use this repository. No configuration is required to serve on `:8082` and metrics at `:9092/metrics` in Prometheus format.

### Local development

We support a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) environment in paygate that can be used to launch the entire Moov stack. After setup launching the stack is the following steps and we offer a testing utility [`apitest` from the moov-io/api repository](https://github.com/moov-io/api#apitest).

Using the [latest released `docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate/releases/latest) is recommended as that will use released versions of dependencies.

```
$ docker-compose up -d
paygate_ach_1 is up-to-date

```

### Build from source

PayGate orchestrates several services that depend on Docker and additional GoLang libraries to run. Paygate leverages [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies. Ensure that your build environment is running Go 1.14 or greater. PayGate depends on other Docker containers that will be downloaded for testing and running the service. Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) is installed and running.

```
$ cd moov/paygate # wherever this project lives

$ go run .

#### Depository Verification

In order to validate `Depository` objects and transfer money PayGate needs to verify the user is authorized to access the `Depository`. This typically involves micro-deposits (sending two debits under $1 to the account and having the user confirm these amounts) followed by a credit from the account to balance the accounting.

## Contributing

Yes please! Please review our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/moov-io/ach/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started! Checkout our [issues for first time contributors](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate/contribute) for something to help out with.

Paygate includes several "long" tests which spawn Docker containers, make requests over the internet, and perform more complicated tests. To skip these long tests add the `-short` flag to `go test`.

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go 1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

### Further Reading

### Test Coverage

Improving test coverage is a good candidate for new contributors while also allowing the project to move more quickly by reducing regressions issues that might not be caught before a release is pushed out to our users. One great way to improve coverage is by adding edge cases and different inputs to functions (or [contributing and running fuzzers](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz)).

Tests can run processes (like sqlite databases), but should only do so locally.

Each PR should increase the overall coverage, if possible. You can run `make cover-test` to save a coverage profile and `make cover-web` to open the HTML view in your default browser.
