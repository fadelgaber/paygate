            Trace Numbers uniquely identify each entry within a batch in an ACH input file. In association with the Batch Number, transmission (File Creation) Date, and File ID Modifier, the Trace Number uniquely identifies an entry within a given file.
            For addenda Records, the Trace Number will be identical to the Trace Number in the associated Entry Detail Record, since the Trace Number is associated with an entry or item rather than a physical record.
